          Did you know that you can create perfect fractal patterns by repeatedly following a few random rules? I recently discovered this through a fascinating video about the Sierpiński triangle and the <em>Chaos Game</em> that sparked my interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fractals are structures that are still detailed at small scales… a kind of rough geometry. But when most people speak of fractals, they mean self-similar shapes—patterns that repeat at different scales. So you can zoom in but still see the whole shape.
        </p>

        <p>
          Want to know more? Watch this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4">Sierpiński & the Chaos Game</a><br>
          Or read: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle">Wikipedia: Sierpiński triangle</a>
        </p>

        <p>The process is surprisingly simple:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Start with an equilateral triangle and place a random point inside it.</li>
          <li>Randomly pick one of the triangle’s three vertices.</li>
          <li>Plot a new point halfway between the current point and that vertex.</li>
          <li>Repeat the last two steps thousands of times.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A fractal pattern will emerge:</p>

        </figure>

        </figure>

        <p>
          I was hooked. What would happen if I changed two simple things?
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>The step</strong> – how far the point moves toward the vertex (e.g. 0.5 = halfway).</li>
          <li><strong>The number of vertices</strong> – not just 3, but 4, 5, or more.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          To explore this, I wrote a Python script using matplotlib. A day later, I had a working website and a simulator.
          I labeled each result with the format <code>S;V</code> – step size and number of vertices.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Chaos_Game_6.png" alt="Fractal S=1.5, V=3" />
          <figcaption><strong>1.5;3</strong> — One step past Sierpiński. Unexpected behavior emerges.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Chaos_Game_4.png" alt="Fractal S=0.6, V=4" />
          <figcaption><strong>0.6;4</strong> — A classic example of self-similarity.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Chaos_Game_3.png" alt="Fractal S=1.4, V=5" />
          <figcaption><strong>1.4;5</strong> — Almost circular. Very different from the triangle pattern.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Chaos_Game_5.png" alt="Fractal S=0.6, V=5" />
          <figcaption><strong>0.6;5</strong> — A flipped pentagon emerges in the center.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          I noticed a consistent pattern: when S is between <strong>0.5 and 0.8</strong>, self-similar fractals tend to form—regardless of the number of vertices.
        </p>

        <p>
          That makes intuitive sense: at S = 1, you're just hitting the vertex. But as S decreases, a structure forms through avoidance.
        </p>

        <p>
          I might write another post diving deeper into the math. For now, try the simulator:

        </p>

        <p>
          If you find interesting patterns—especially ones without a central void or with strange symmetry—drop a comment.
