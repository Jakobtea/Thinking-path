          Every human breakthrough from using fire to landing on the moon is only possible through one invisible force: learning.

          Every skill — from taking our first breath to tying your shoes, to writing a PhD thesis in quantum physics — depends on learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore learning is a meta-skill, a skill that is beneficial and fundamental for every human being. 
          Public speaking and problem solving are powerful meta-skills. But one could argue that learning is the most important and life changing meta-skill, 
          because the foundation of every meta skill — whether it’s problem solving or public speaking — lies in the ability to learn.

          Often when I tell this to people, they can’t quite understand it, that has nothing to do with their cognitive abilities, but with how they grew up. 
          Most of us were never taught how to learn. Instead, we were told to just repeat information until it stuck. 
          This misconception of learning might work in the short term, but leaves us unmotivated and unfocused in the long run.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you master the skill of learning itself you don’t just remember more, you also improve your focus and motivation — and, most importantly, it increases the overall joy in life in general. 
          Research suggests that people who practice continuous or lifelong learning are happier on average.

          In these articles I will share a science-based learning method, that helped me gain admission to one of the most prestigious high schools in Germany — and will help you to achieve (nearly) anything.
