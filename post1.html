          Every human breakthrough from using fire to landing on the moon is only possible through one invisible force: learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every skill — from taking our first breath to tying our shoes, to writing a PhD thesis in quantum physics — depends on learning. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, learning is a meta-skill, a skill that is beneficial and fundamental for every human being. Public speaking and problem-solving are powerful meta-skills. But one could argue that learning is the most important and life-changing meta-skill, because the foundation of every meta skill — whether it’s problem solving or public speaking — lies in the ability to learn.

        <p>
          Often when I tell this to people, they can’t quite understand it. That has nothing to do with their cognitive abilities, but with how they grew up. Most of us were never taught how to learn. Instead, we were told to just repeat information until it stuck. This misconception of learning might work in the short term, but it leaves us unmotivated and unfocused in the long run. 
        </p>

        <p>
          When you master the skill of learning itself, you don’t just remember more, you also improve your focus and motivation — and, most importantly, it increases the overall joy in life in general. Research suggests that people who practice continuous or lifelong learning are happier on average.

          In this article, I will share a science-based learning method that will help you to achieve (nearly) anything.

        <h3>Basics</h3>
        <p>
          First of all, I want to make clear what you cannot expect from this method. So if you're looking for an easy way to get into Oxford, this is not it. This is also not about learning stuff just as fast as possible, so if you have an exam tomorrow, you should probably stop reading now. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Effective learning is a way of learning that is, well, effective. In the context of learning, that means storing information over a long time while memorizing it in the shortest possible time without burning out — and having fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before we look at the method to study effectively, it is essential to understand (on a very basic level) how the brain works.

        <h3>How the brain learns</h3>
        <p>
          The brain is the most complex object in the observable universe. So trying to explain it here is not difficult but simply impossible, because no one really understands it. Sidenote: I do find it quite funny how so little is known about something that everyone has. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite these facts, we do have a good understanding of how the brain learns, and here is the short form:
        </p>

        <p>
          In the late 19th century, the biologist Ramón y Cajal introduced the idea of neuron theory — the idea that the brain is not one mystical thing but consists of many singular cells (neurons) like the rest of our body. He was, like so many other groundbreakers, first harshly criticized for this “ridiculous” idea, which turned out to be true. In 1906, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for it. 
        </p>

        <p>
          So the brain is made up of many (86 billion) neurons, which communicate with each other over connections called synapses. When we learn something, some connections get stronger and some get weaker. Repeated activation makes the connections stronger (long-term potentiation), while infrequent use weakens synapses (long-term depression). 
        </p>

        <p>
          Think of a path in a forest: if many people walk over the grass, the path becomes more and more established. But when no one uses it, the grass slowly grows again, “weakening” the path. Two neurotransmitters are crucial for our success in learning. First, there is the famous dopamine, which signals reward and motivation. Acetylcholine sharpens our attention and helps the brain to focus on relevant input. 
        </p>

        <p>There are three stages of learning:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> The phase where we pick up new information, e.g., through a textbook or a lecture.</li>
          <li><strong>Consolidation:</strong> The information is stored and stabilized (this mostly happens during sleep).</li>
          <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong> Stored information is recalled, which strengthens the connections.</li>
        </ol>
